# Traits (Step 1 of gks_scv_condition_proc)

## Overview

Step 1 of the `clinvar_ingest.gks_scv_condition_proc` procedure builds GKS-compliant trait records from ClinVar's normalized `trait` table. Each output record includes a primary coding (MedGen when available), cross-reference mappings to external ontologies (OMIM, MONDO, HPO, Orphanet, MeSH, EFO), and ClinVar-specific extensions. The resulting `temp_gks_trait` table serves as the lookup for the [Condition Sets](condition-sets.md) step (Step 15), which joins it with condition mapping results to build the final condition structures.

## Workflow

The procedure executes as a single query with two CTEs within a loop over the target schema(s) identified by the `on_date` parameter.

### Step 1: Extract Traits

The `traits` CTE selects distinct trait records from the `trait` table, extracting:

- Trait `id`, `type`, and preferred `name`
- Alternate names concatenated into a comma-separated `synonyms` string
- Cross-references parsed from the raw `xrefs` field via the `clinvar_ingest.parseXRefItems` UDF

### Step 2: Build Trait Cross-References

The `trait_xrefs` CTE unnests each trait's parsed xrefs and builds a coding struct for each cross-reference. Each coding includes:

- The database name (`system`) and identifier (`code`)
- An array of IRIs — an identifiers.org canonical IRI and a secondary browsable URL

Cross-references are filtered to include only:

- Non-Gene databases (Gene xrefs are excluded)
- Records with no `ref_field` (inline xrefs only)
- Primary type xrefs (or xrefs with no type specified)

### Step 3: Aggregate into `temp_gks_trait`

The final query joins traits with their cross-references and aggregates into one row per trait:

- **`primaryCoding`** — the MedGen coding, selected as the first non-null MedGen xref. The MedGen coding includes the trait name in its `name` field
- **`mappings`** — all non-MedGen codings wrapped with a `relatedMatch` relation
- **`aliases`** — an array of alternate names/synonyms (present only when synonyms exist)
- **`extensions`** — an array containing:
  - `clinvarTraitId` — the ClinVar trait ID
  - `clinvarTraitType` — the trait type (e.g., Disease, Finding, PhenotypeInstruction)

**Output:** `temp_gks_trait` — one row per trait with structured codings, mappings, and extensions. <span class="role-badge badge-internal">Internal</span>

## conceptType Mapping (ClinVar → GKS)

Each trait's ClinVar `type` is mapped to a standardized GKS `conceptType` — the value carried on the emitted condition's [MappableConcept](../../output-reference/overview.md) and used to distinguish diseases, phenotypes, and other traits. The mapping is applied in Step 1 (`gks_scv_condition_proc`) and yields one of four `conceptType` values: **`Disease`**, **`Phenotype`**, **`Trait`**, or **`Condition`**.

| ClinVar trait `type` | GKS `conceptType` | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Disease` | `Disease` | A named disease. |
| `Finding` | `Phenotype` | Clinical findings are surfaced as phenotypes. |
| `DrugResponse` | `Condition` | Drug-response traits are generic conditions. |
| `BloodGroup` | `Trait` | Non-disease heritable trait. |
| `NamedProteinVariant` | `Trait` | Non-disease heritable trait. |
| `PhenotypeInstruction` | `Trait` | Non-disease heritable trait. |
| *(any other type)* | `Condition` | Fallback when the ClinVar type is unrecognized. |

`conceptType` is descriptive, not a schema discriminator: every condition is a GKS `MappableConcept` regardless of its `conceptType`. Downstream, the four values let consumers filter diseases (`Disease`) from phenotypes (`Phenotype`) and other heritable traits (`Trait`) without parsing the underlying ontology namespace.

## IRI Mapping Reference

Each supported database maps to a pair of IRIs — a canonical identifiers.org IRI and a secondary browsable URL:

| Database | identifiers.org Pattern | Secondary URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MedGen | `https://identifiers.org/medgen:{id}` | `https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/{id}` |
| OMIM | `https://identifiers.org/mim:{id}` | `https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/{id}` |
| Human Phenotype Ontology | `https://identifiers.org/{id}` | `https://hpo.jax.org/browse/term/{id}` |
| MONDO | `https://identifiers.org/mondo:{digits}` | `http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_{digits}` |
| Orphanet | `https://identifiers.org/orphanet.ordo:Orphanet_{id}` | `http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_{id}` |
| MeSH | `https://identifiers.org/mesh:{id}` | `https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/?term={id}` |
| EFO | `https://identifiers.org/efo:{id}` | `http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_{id}` |

MONDO IDs are normalized by extracting the numeric portion — `MONDO:0000001` becomes `0000001` in both IRI patterns.
